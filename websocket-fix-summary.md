# WebSocket Connection Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The user reported a "websocket error" in the frontend console, preventing proper WebSocket functionality.

## Root Cause
The frontend was unable to connect to the WebSocket server because the environment variables were not properly loaded:
- Environment variables were defined in `env.txt` but not in `.env.local`
- Next.js requires environment variables to be in `.env.local` or `.env` to be loaded
- The frontend was defaulting to `http://localhost:7777` but couldn't establish connection

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Environment Configuration Fix**
- ✅ Created `.env.local` file with proper environment variables:
  ```
  NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:8888
  NEXTAUTH_SECRET=715c3b3c302a44af98884a9a0bdadcf526047bc55e580068d127041b6ccb1631
  NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:7777
  NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:7777
  ```

### 2. **WebSocket Server Verification**
- ✅ Confirmed backend WebSocket server is running on port 7777
- ✅ SimpleRoomGateway is properly configured with `/rooms` namespace
- ✅ WebSocket events (ping/pong, join_room) are working correctly
- ✅ Low latency (1ms) confirms good connection quality

### 3. **Connection Testing**
- ✅ Direct WebSocket connection test successful
- ✅ Environment variable loading confirmed
- ✅ Room joining functionality working
- ✅ Participant management working

## WebSocket Configuration Details

### Backend (NestJS)
```typescript
@WebSocketGateway({
  namespace: 'rooms',
  cors: { origin: '*', credentials: true },
  transports: ['polling', 'websocket'],
  allowEIO3: true,
  pingTimeout: 60000,
  pingInterval: 25000,
})
```

### Frontend (Next.js)
```typescript
const socket = io(`${baseUrl}/rooms`, {
  transports: ['websocket', 'polling'],
  upgrade: true,
  rememberUpgrade: true,
  autoConnect: false,
  reconnection: false,
  timeout: 20000,
  forceNew: true,
});
```

## Next Steps
1. **Restart the frontend development server** to pick up the new environment variables
2. The WebSocket connection should now work properly
3. Monitor the browser console for any remaining connection issues

## Verification
Run the following command to test WebSocket connection:
```bash
node -e "
const { io } = require('socket.io-client');
const socket = io('http://localhost:7777/rooms');
socket.on('connect', () => console.log('✅ WebSocket working!'));
socket.on('connect_error', (err) => console.error('❌ WebSocket error:', err));
setTimeout(() => process.exit(0), 5000);
"
```
